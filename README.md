# DBT Modelling using AIRBNB Data

This repo is used for learning purposes. The project aims to use DBT for Data Modelling with Airbnb data hosted within Amazon Redshift (and are visualized with Looker Studio).

This project is based loosely on the course of [dbt zero to hero]("https://github.com/nordquant/complete-dbt-bootcamp-zero-to-hero"). But focusing more on using ingesting csv data to Redshift and repractising my dbt skills with a different dataset.

Any comments or crtiques are appreciated.

### To do list
- Ingesting data from csv to redshift
