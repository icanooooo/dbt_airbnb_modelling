This project is based loosely on the course of [dbt zero to hero](https://github.com/nordquant/complete-dbt-bootcamp-zero-to-hero). But focusing more on using Google Cloud Service buckets to store csv files, ingesting it to bigquery and repractising my data modelling skills with a different dataset.

The dashboard can be opened [here](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/8a45ff57-fd4d-4d65-a9ba-4b0401deaafe). It's not finished yet, but if you want to play around and check my progress, you can check it there.

Any comments or crtiques are appreciated.
